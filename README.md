Introduction
Medical image segmentation plays a pivotal role in enhancing diagnostic accuracy and guiding clinical treatments. Traditional methods often struggle with inadequate or ambiguous local features. To address this, we propose CFE-UNet, a novel deep convolutional neural network model specifically designed for efficient medical image segmentation. CFE-UNet introduces two key modules: the Input Information Enhancement (IIE) module and the Multi-scale Context Information Fusion (MCIF) module. The IIE module leverages large kernel convolutions to broaden the receptive field and introduce rich edge details, significantly boosting segmentation accuracy, especially for small, detail-rich targets. The MCIF module facilitates multi-scale feature fusion and channel shuffle, optimizing the flow of feature information and enhancing feature representation. Additionally, it incorporates an information refining component to suppress irrelevant information and noise, further improving model performance. Extensive experiments on five medical imaging datasets demonstrate that CFE-UNet achieves impressive segmentation performance while maintaining low parameters and floating-point operations per second (FLOPs). Our work contributes to the development of more efficient and accurate medical image segmentation models.
